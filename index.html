    <div class="card card-why-we-exist">
        <h2>Why we exist</h2>
        <p>We believe food is more than just something you eat—it’s a connection to life, to nature, and to the people 
            who grow it. In a world that feels increasingly disconnected, we exist to bring food closer to its roots. 
            Our purpose is simple: to nourish not just bodies, but relationships with the earth and each other. 
            We do this by growing fresh, local produce that inspires people to live healthier, more sustainable lives.</p>
        <p>We are Wild at Heart.</p>

    <div class="card card-why-mushrooms">
        <h2>Why mushrooms</h2>

            well-being.</p>
        <p>In today’s world, where health is our greatest priority, specialty mushrooms stand out for their unique ability
             to nourish our bodies while delighting our taste buds. We focus on growing exotic varieties
              that are not only rich in benefits but also versatile and delicious—making them an ideal choice for your 
              kitchen. Each mushroom we cultivate reflects our commitment to health, sustainability, and the joy of good food.</p>
