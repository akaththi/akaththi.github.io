    </div>

    <div class="card card-why-we-exist">
        <h2>Why we exist</h2>
        <p>We believe that food is more than just sustenance—it’s the essence of life. What we eat directly impacts how we feel, how we connect with others, and how we live each day. That’s why we’re on a mission to revolutionize how food is grown and consumed, starting with something as humble yet extraordinary as mushrooms.</p>
        <p>With the world shifting toward healthier, more conscious choices, we knew we had to take a stand—to provide food that is not only fresh and flavorful but also ethical and pure. Our commitment is to connect people with the best nature has to offer, bringing food that nourishes both the body and the soul. We are Akaththi Farms, and we’re here to grow a healthier future for all of us.</p>

    <div class="card card-why-mushrooms">
        <h2>Why mushrooms</h2>
        <p>Mushrooms are more than just an ingredient—they are <strong>nature’s gift to our health</strong>. Packed with nutrients, vitamins, and antioxidants, mushrooms are true superfoods that boost immunity and promote overall well-being.</p>
        <p>In these times, when health has become our greatest priority, we chose to focus on specialty mushrooms for their unique ability to support our bodies while delighting our taste buds. At Akaththi Farms, we grow exotic varieties that are not only delicious but also rich in benefits, making them the perfect addition to any meal.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card card-how-it-works">
        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <p>We’ve redefined how mushrooms are grown. Using our innovative <strong>Micro-Farm Architecture</strong>, powered by <strong>kaaniOS</strong>, we can cultivate exotic mushrooms and microgreens in small urban farms, bringing fresh food closer to you than ever before. These farms are designed to be net-zero, meaning they’re built with sustainability at their core.</p>
        <p>We optimize everything—from resource usage to growing conditions—so you can enjoy fresh produce that’s good for both you and the environment. By combining organic farming practices with modern technology, we’re delivering purity, freshness, and flavor to every customer.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-no-border card-our-vision">
        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>We envision a world where food is not just a commodity but a celebration of life. At Akaththi Farms, we’re rethinking farming by embracing a net-zero approach that brings food closer to where it's consumed. Our dream is simple yet bold: to create super-local urban farms that cultivate fresh, exotic mushrooms and greens right in the heart of communities.</p>
        <p>It’s about more than just feeding people—it’s about restoring the connection between individuals and the food they eat. Through this, we aim to nurture healthier lives, tastier meals, and a more sustainable planet.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-no-border card-our-mission">

        <p>We’re not just farming; we’re crafting experiences that make eating well feel easy and natural. By spreading awareness of the health benefits of mushrooms, we aim to nourish both body and mind—one meal at a time.</p>
